(AAPL) has announced that it will halt sales of its flagship Apple Watch models in the United States.
According to 9to5Mac, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will no longer be available to purchase from Apple starting later this week.
The Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 will no longer be available to order from Apple's website in the U.S. after 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, December 21. In-store inventory will no longer be available from Apple retail locations after December 24.
The decision is based on an ITC ruling related to a patent dispute between Apple and medical technology company Masimo around the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensor technology.
The International Trade Commission announced its ruling in October, upholding a judge's decision from January. This sent the case to the Biden administration for a 60-day Presidential Review Period.
During this process, President Biden could veto the ruling, although this has not yet occurred. The Presidential Review Period expires on December 25, and Apple is making this announcement today to ""preemptively"" take steps to comply with the ITC's decision.
In a statement, Masimo said the ban ""demonstrates that even the world's most powerful company must abide by the law.""
""The ITC found that Apple stole Masimo's patented pulse oximetry technology, which measures blood oxygen,"" the company said. ""The ITC undertook a thorough legal process and its expert judgment in this matter should be respected, protecting intellectual property rights and maintaining public trust in the United States' patent system.""

About Dashan Huang: Dashan Huang is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University. His paper ""Twin Momentum"" looked at combining traditional price momentum with improving fundamentals to generate market outperformance. In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward. When he combined that measure with price momentum, he was able to double its outperformance.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the dominant trade in 2023, with no shortage of AI stocks to buy. Just about any stock linked to AI has risen over the last 12 months, from heavyweights such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to smaller start-ups such as C3.ai (NYSE:AI). While some analysts say AI is played out and fully priced into the market, don’t believe it.
As technology that is in its infancy and likely to continue dominating society for the foreseeable future, AI can be expected to be a stock market driver for many years. Most companies are only now beginning to monetize the technology. And Fortune Business Insights expects theglobal marketfor AI to quadruple to $2 trillion by 2030. Want to be in the AI millionaires club? Here are three top stocks you need to own now.
Adobe (ADBE)

Admittedly, its guidance for the coming year wasn’t great, but software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) remains a great bet on the future of AI. Investors can now buy ADBE stock a little cheaper, with the share price down 6% after the company issued a weak outlook for 2024. Lost in the concern over the guidance was that Adobe’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings beat Wall Street forecasts, with the company reporting earnings per share (EPS) of $4.27 compared to the $4.14 that was anticipated.
Revenue in the latest quarter totaled $5.05 billion versus $5.03 billion that analysts estimated. The company’s revenue grew 12% from a year ago while its net income increased 26% to $1.48 billion, or $3.23 per share. During the quarter, Adobe increased the costs of some of its software subscriptions, notably those that now include AI. In the most recent quarter, Adobe’s Firefly generative AI feature became available in the company’s Photoshop and Illustrator programs, and it is now monetizing AI.
ADBE stock has increased 74% in 2023.
Apple (AAPL)

For a less obvious AI play, consider consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In early 2024, the company will release its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, Apple’s first entirely new product since the launch of the Apple Watch in 2014. There’s speculation that the Vision Pro headset could be Apple’s push into video games and that the company is eyeing AI-based gaming as a future endeavor. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the company is investing in AI and already makes its own microchips for its iPhones and MacBook computers.
While we wait for Apple to clarify its intentions for AI, it’s important to note that the stock is on a tear, recently closing at an all-time high on a split-adjusted basis. Apple’s share price has now risen 59% in 2023, putting the company’s market capitalization at $3.08 trillion, the biggest of any publicly traded company. Over the past year, Apple’s market value has grown by nearly $1 trillion. Analysts see continued catalysts for AAPL stock from renewed growth in its iPhone sales and the continued expansion of its services arm, which includes its streaming platform. Plus, new AI products.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Now for more or a slam dunk when it comes to AI. That would be chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company’s share price has gained 20% since the start of December when the company introduced a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040,” aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. The new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs) made by companies such as Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) starting in early 2024.
AMD also announced that its new MI300X accelerator microchip is now available for sale. That chip is used in data centers and directly competes with Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI data center chips. While investors and analysts love the new AI chips, they are also responding to AMD executives who recently said that they expect the AI data center chip to generate $2 billion of revenue for all of 2024. AMD stock is up 120% in 2023 with continued momentum behind it.

NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged higher and the Nasdaq fell Thursday afternoon as investors took a breather a day after a sharp rally on signals from the Federal Reserve that borrowing costs would drop next year.
Apple AAPL.O shares were down 0.2% after hitting a record high in the session.
Investors were closely watching 10-year Treasury yields, which broke below 4% for the first time since early August in the wake of the Fed statement. They were last down at 3.94%.
""The market by any measure and any metric is overbought and has been overbought, and a consolidation or a pause has been expected, especially after yesterday's surge,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""While the market celebrates lower rates, it can question why yields are below 4%"" as investors weigh the economic outlook, she added.
The Fed left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, with Chair Jerome Powell saying the historic tightening of monetary policy was likely over, as inflation falls faster than expected, and discussions on cuts in borrowing costs were coming ""into view.""
